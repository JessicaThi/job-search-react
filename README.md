<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22913672/107240428-2f51e900-6a2a-11eb-9cd3-d96ba899663a.png)

#### What I learned
- calls API with [GitHub Jobs API]( https://jobs.github.com/api)
- filter data
- pagination
- handle params url

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [GitHub Jobs API]( https://jobs.github.com/api)

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/Bu3G2irnaXmfwQ8sZkw8) was to build an application to complete the given user stories :

- [x] I can see a list of jobs in a city by default
- [x] I can search for jobs with a given keyword
- [x] I can search for jobs with a city name, zip code or other location
- [ ] I can select one option from at least 4 pre-defined options
- [x] I can see a list of jobs with their logo, company name, location, and posted time.
- [x] When I select a job, I can see job descriptions and how to apply like the given design.
- [x] When I am on the job details page, I can go back to the search page
- [ ] I can see a list of jobs in the closest city from my location by default (optional)
- [x] I can see jobs in different pages, 5 items each page (optional)

## How To Use

<!-- Example: -->

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/JessicaThi/job-search-react.git

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the app
$ npm start
```

## Getting Started
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/import?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
